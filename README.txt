----------------------INDIGO FROST PHYSICS ENGINE----------------------
---------------------------Kamaron Peterson----------------------------

	The Indigo Frost physics engine started out as a "pet project"
for me, and when I realized how well everything was coming together,
I started serious development on a complete physics engine, which could
be used by game developers, be they hobbyist, professional or students.

	Indigo Frost is licensed under the MIT license. I don't like
the GNU license because it limits usage to only other open source
projects, and I don't want that. If you want to add features to my
engine and sell it commercially, more power to you. Let me know, I'd
love to see it. I would take that as the highest of compliments.
