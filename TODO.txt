----------------------------------------TODO LIST----------------------------------------

------MAINTENENCE------
-Organize all physics code into files for easy integration into projects
++Physics -> Forces / Contacts / Managers

-Add an Ogre integrator - manager that binds particles to scene nodes,
   and updates the scene nodes as particles are updated
   
-Create documentation for each class, and a begin to end application guide
   (for adding to projects, especially Ogre)
   
------PHYSICS------
-Create multiple constructors for the RigidBody class

-Fix BasicSpring class - I think the magnitudes are off.
   When a basic spring attaches two objects at the origin, it attracts them
   until they occupy the same space - it shouldn't. They should be separated
   by the distance of restLength, which they aren't.
