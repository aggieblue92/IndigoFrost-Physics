----------------------------------------TODO LIST----------------------------------------

------MAINTENENCE------
-Organize all physics code into files for easy integration into projects
++Physics -> Forces / Contacts / Managers

-Add an Ogre integrator - manager that binds particles to scene nodes,
   and updates the scene nodes as particles are updated
   
-Create documentation for each class, and a begin to end application guide
   (for adding to projects, especially Ogre)
   
------PHYSICS------
-Create multiple constructors for the RigidBody class

-Matrix4 class: Make Transform and TransformDirn (p.206) functions do
   what they're supposed to - transform a position and direction
   vector (respectively) by the matrix or something like that.
   THIS IS ACTUALLY LIKE SUPER VITAL.
