-Finish adding DebugLogger support to the rest of the engine
-Add WorldManager file format that it can read in and write out to, to create complete scenes.
 ++ This will help with debugging - you can dump out a world state as well as the initial world state, and use it in more controlled testing.
 ++ Perhaps in the samples add a key listener that creates a snapshot when the user presses a key.
 ++ In the testing playback, maybe keep a buffer of many frames that can be used?
