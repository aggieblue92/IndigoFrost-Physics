                    This documentation page is the high school English teacher of documentation pages, because the amount
                    of description that goes into the <code>IForce</code> class will certainly be <i>more lengthy than
                    the class itself.</i> Also, it makes a metaphor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Joking aside, the <code>IForce</code> class is an interface from which all forces in the Indigo Frost
                    physics engine derive. It contains only one method, <code>ApplyForce</code>, which is used to apply the
                    actions caused by that force to a given <code>IPhysicsObject</code> instance. The <code>IPhysicsObject</code>
                    instance is a parameter to that method instead of a property of the class, because one force may act on
                    multiple objects identically (e.g., gravity) or transferred between objects (e.g., a slight speedup to
                    a character who is 'it' in a tag-like game).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is where a good chunk of the extending of the Indigo Frost physics engine will go for your own game
                    engine. Indigo Frost comes with a suite of generic forces (springs, gravity, etc.) but all internal
                    application of forces uses nothing more specific than this interfaces. As such, forces unique to your
                    game can be implemented simply by extending this class.

                <p>Most likely, the <code>duration</code> parameter of the <code>ApplyForce</code> function will be
                ignored, since it is a parameter of the methods of <code>IPhysicsObject</code> that have to deal with
                calculating changes in velocity and position of the attached object (see the below note). However, the
                parameter exists for forces that are variable with time.</p>
				<p>Implementations of <code>IForce</code> will probably use the <code>addForceAtOrigin</code>,
                <code>addForceAtPoint</code>, and <code>addTorqueAtOrigin</code> methods of the <code>IPhysicsObject</code>
                class. Use of the <code>impulse</code> member is also possible and likely.</p>
                <p>In this version of Indigo Frost, this function is a <code>void</code> function. I have played with
                the idea of making it return a <code>bool</code> instead, returning <code>false</code> when the force has
                been spent, and the manager is free to remove it from the system (for temporary forces). However, I decided
                not to. You may consider changing this if you dive deep under the hood of Indigo Frost for your own project.</p>
                <p><b>Be careful</b> when programming your own forces into the engine - remember that at the heart of a real-time
                physics engine, an integral that represents the derivation of an object's position from its velocity and
                velocity from its acceleration is represented as a Riemann sum. For most cases, with a time difference per frame
                of between 0.01 and 0.05 ms, this is fine - but if you aren't careful, forces can easily become wildly inaccurate.
                The classic example is in springs - if damping is not applied to the system, and a spring is simply given the
                Hooke's law formula, the spring will display a larger displacement per oscillation, and eventually spring off into
                infinity. <i>This is bad.</i></p>
