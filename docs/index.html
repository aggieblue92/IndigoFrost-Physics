				<p>The Indigo Frost physics engine is a real-time physics engine written in a highly object-oriented fashion. It is largely customisable, and is (at its current version) not intended to be used as a final project, but rather to be extended to fit in with the developer's needs. Interfaces for collisions, forces, and objects are provided, and can be extended to fit better with specific requirements. As it stands, the Indigo Frost physics engine is intended for video game developers.</p>
				<p>The development of the Indigo Frost engine was done with three goals in mind:</p>
				<ul><li>Extensibility</li><li>Cross-Platform</li><li>Plays nicely with external libraries</li></ul>
				<p>Specifically, Indigo Frost was written with Ogre3D in mind, though much of the testing was done with a very basic graphics engine developed externally, that uses the XNAMath libraries. All mathematical structures are built to fit seamlessly in with other mathematical structures used in other engines.</p>
