Perhaps you should change the structure of the engine -

WorldMan takes in IPhysicsObjects sure, but all the collisions, forces, etc. instead go to a derived class,
  perhaps FullPhysicsObject?
  This allows for objects like Bullet, Fireball, etc. whatever, to be included, without having to conform to the
  rules you're giving to the IPhysicsObject

CollisionBox: You're catching zero magnitude exceptions for contacts in the case of no interpenetration - instead,
  you could create and apply a NoInterpenetrationContact or something?
